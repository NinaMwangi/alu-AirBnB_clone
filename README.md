This is a full web application based on Airbnb. In this project we will clone the Airbnb website.
The project AirBnB clone will be composed of:
1. A command interpreter used to manipulate data.
2. A front end that will display both dynamic and static content.
3. A database or file to store data.
4. An API that links the database to the front end.

# The Console....

For this Command interpreter we want to be able to manage the objects of our project. We can create an object, retrieve an object from a file, we are also able to use help to gain clarity on what a method does.We are also able to update and object and destroy it.
You can run this console both interactively and non-interactively. To use the console interactively use:
$ ./console.py (hbnb) help
