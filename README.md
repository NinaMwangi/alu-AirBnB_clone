# alu-AirBnB_clone

This is a full web application based on Airbnb. In this project we will clone the Airbnb website.
The project AirBnB clone will be composed of:
1. A command interpreter used to manipulate data.
2. A front end that will display both dynamic and static content.
3. A database or file to store data.
4. An API that links the database to the front end.
